### Results
The Results directory contains many files.  Everything stems from the `.csv` files:

- `sort_duration-1m.csv`
- `sort_duration-10m.csv`
- `sort_duration-100m.csv`

The component of the filename, `-1m` etc, refers to how many integers were in the list being sorted.  In this
case: 1 million.

The next files generated were the `.ods` - Libre Office Calc files.  Here a graph was included and the various 
other files generated.

The `sort_duration_scaling.ods` file was created to include the averages for each algorithm, using each of 
the list sizes.  A graph was also included.
